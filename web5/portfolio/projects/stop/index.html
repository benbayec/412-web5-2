                    This video was done for a stopmotion animation for my video editing class.
                    During the pandemic I had a really hard time keeping up with school, I suppose
                    this short story is a testament to it.

                    Coming up with the story in my head and watching it unfold into something tangible felt really great to me.
                    Of course, Photoshop was used, but I also utilzed a sandbox game called GMOD, to create reference materials for certain
                    objects in the video such as the phone and the bed.

                   The drawing process could've gone way faster if my device was better, especially when it came to the splatter effect,
                   which would take at least 10-15 seconds to render. The editing process was a bit difficult as well since I was still new to Premiere.
                   Unfortunately I couldn't salvage any analog sketches since they have been lost to time.
