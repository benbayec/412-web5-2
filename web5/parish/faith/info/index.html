            <div><h1>The Pillars of the Program</h1></div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Here at St. Thomas à Becket, we follow a FAMILY-BASED approach that runs from September-May
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 4 main components are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mass</li>
                    <li>Children's Faith Experience & Seesaw</li>
                    <li>Work Book</li>
                    <li>Parent/Family component</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When all the components of the program are met, your child will receive a completion certificate to move on to the next level the following year.
                </p>

            <div><h1>Mass</h1></div>
            <div id="des1">
                <p>
                    Regular attendance of Mass is required throughout the program.
                    Holy Mass is the centre of our faith and the source of divine life.
                    The Sacraments are therefore given to us, so that we become full members of the Church and participants of this divine life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is our dearest wish that children who receive their sacraments here at St. Thomas à Becket 
                    have a feeling that they truly belong here — that this church is a home and a family for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order for this to happen, the children need to come to church regularly, so they experience it as a routine, 
                    a comfortable place where they are known, a place where they can come to know Jesus and His love.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We need community as much as we need the Sacraments!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    *Weekly Reflections are back! 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Weekly reflections are meant to help children participate in the Mass as well as begin the practice of including Jesus in their everyday lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will find our Reflection slips on the small table in the hall each week 
                    and are to be filled out before Mass and dropped in the basket as you walk into the church.
                </p>
                <h2>Weekend Mass Schedule:</h2>
                <ul>

            <p>
                We offer a hybrid approach to the Faith education of our children. 
               We will meet in the Church at least once with each group keeping safety protocols in mind. 
               We will continue to use Seesaw to give presentations and fun activities. For a snapshot of the past on Seesaw, click here

            <p>
                Each child will receive a book from Loyola Press or a duo tang prepared by our team according to their level.
                These books are to be completed at home but will be checked from time to time to help keep everyone on track.
            </p>
            <p>
                *Books and/or Duo tangs will be distributed mid-September, 2023.

                    At your child's baptism, you agreed to be the primary teacher of the faith to your children. 
                    Now We offer support to help you to grow your own faith in order to pass it on to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have many different parish groups and adult faith enrichment courses available
                    to all our parishioners which can assist with your own faith journey and give you the tools 
                    to encourage and educate your children during their Faith journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are overjoyed to offer 2 programs on a regular basis at St. Thomas à Becket: The Search and Sycamore. 
                    There are also other opportunities for faith exploration particularly during Advent or Lent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All Faith First families are strongly encouraged to join one of 
                    our many parish groups and/or one of the Faith enrichment sessions. 
                    Many of our sessions are via Zoom where you can enjoy in the comfort of your home.
                    You will receive invitations on a regular basis so you know the next available session dates. 
                    Family and friends are most welcome to join you as together you embark on an exciting Faith journey.
