                We know that you want to do your best to help your children grow
                up with good values and a life of faith. We want to partner with you in that amazing endeavour.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Sacrament of Baptism was the first step.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now your child is at an age where they are invited to complete the Sacraments of Initiation:
                First Communion, Reconciliation and Confirmation.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, to help us along the way.
            </p>
            <p>Children are asked to complete each level of faith education that runs from Grade 1 to Grade 6.</p>

            <p>An intensive High School catechesis is offered to those who begin the program a little older.</p>

                    How wonderful that you are seeking this beautiful sacrament for your child!
                    The First Communion process at St. Thomas a Becket is a two-year commitment.
                    The earliest they can receive the sacrament is Grade 2.
                    Celebrations usually take place during the month of May.

                <p>
                    Children getting ready for First Communion will also receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation as part of their preparation.
                    Children make their First Confession in advance of their First Communion.
                    This Sacrament is usually celebrated a few months before their First Communion.

                    <p>
                        It's wonderful that your child is ready to prepare for this important sacrament.
                        Preparation for Confirmation should start immediately after First Communion and
                        is a 4-year preparation celebrating the sacrament in Grade 6 at the earliest.
